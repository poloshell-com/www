## How to install Zsh
> 
> This tutorial is tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. It should work with other versions of Ubuntu as well. If not, tell us in the comments.
> 
> You can install **zsh** with following commands in Debian/Ubuntu based distributions:
> 
>     sudo apt-get update
>     sudo apt-get install zsh
> 
> You need sudoer rights to run above commands. If you don’t have such rights, contact your system admin. If you are the administrator, then [refer to this article to learn about creating a sudoer](https://linuxhandbook.com/create-sudo-user/).
> 
> In [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/), Red Hat and CentOS, you can use the [DNF package manager](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DNF?rd=Dnf) to install Zsh:
